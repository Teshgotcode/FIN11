FINAL REPORT: EXECUTION STRATEGY ANALYSIS (HARRIS THEORY)
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
   - Tested "Trader's Dilemma": Paying for Immediacy (Market Orders) 
     vs. Risking Non-Execution for Price Improvement (Limit Orders).
   - Focus: Reducing Transaction Costs (TCA) in the Summer Period.

2. RESULTS (2020-2024)
   - Average Cost (Aggressive): 64.7 bps
   - Average Cost (Passive):    45.8 bps
   - Net Improvement (Alpha):   18.9 bps

3. ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE
   - By using Passive Limit Orders instead of Aggressive Market Orders during
     the summer, the investor captured a "Liquidity Premium".
   - Total Estimated Savings (spread capture): 9,441 NOK
