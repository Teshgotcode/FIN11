OPTIMAL TRADING WINDOWS:

RECOMMENDED PERIODS (Lower Transaction Costs):
   • Summer Holiday (Weeks 28-30): -13% spread, SAVE up to 5,468 NOK per 5M trade
   • Summer excluding holiday (June-Aug): -6% spread

AVOID PERIODS (Higher Transaction Costs):
   • Christmas (Dec 15-31): +2.8% spread (not significant in full sample)
   • Christmas (Robust sample): +7.6% spread** (SIGNIFICANT after removing COVID)

NEUTRAL PERIODS:
   • Pre-Easter, Post-Easter: No significant effect
   • Rest of year: Baseline liquidity conditions

MARKET CAP CONSIDERATIONS:
   • Large Cap: Always most liquid (1.2% avg spread)
   • Small Cap: 73% wider spreads than Large Cap (consider timing more carefully)

HARRIS THEORY VALIDATION:
   • Lower volume periods → wider spreads (CONFIRMED, p<0.001)
   • Dealer participation matters: Avoid low-volume days within any period

EXECUTION STRATEGY:
   1. For trades >1M NOK: Prioritize summer weeks 28-30
   2. For Small Cap stocks: Timing is MORE important (higher spread sensitivity)
   3. Monitor volume: Even in "good" periods, low volume days = wider spreads
